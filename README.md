### Insight Objective
The compiled data we have on Mount Everest will give the users an experience of what the climate one should expect at different elevations, the dangers and fatalities that occurred in the ascent, and easy-to-access campsites along the North-Col and South-Col routes of Everest within virtual reality. The use of VR leverages a better understanding of the altitudes of campsites along the routes, clearer insight of the weather expressed in that setting, and an immersed scare about the dangers of performing the ascent.

### Gaining Inisght into the Data
Predict two major insights participants will gain:
1.
2.

Person 1:
What he/she knows about Everest
Insights gained after VR experience

Person 2:
What he/she knows about Everest
Insights gained after VR experience

Person 3:
What he/she knows about Everest
Insights gained after VR experience

Discuss if predictions were correct...
